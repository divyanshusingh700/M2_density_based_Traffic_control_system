# M2_density_based_Traffic_control_system
## Introduction
Due to high traffic in industrial and metropolitan cities, the number of vehicles on the roads are exponentially increasing. Which gives rise traffic congestion and many road accidents and hazards. Traffic without adequate guidance can lead to traffic congestions, time dissipation and accidents.
Traffic Lights or Traffic Signals are signalling devices that are used to control the flow of traffic. So for that I have created project for minimising the waiting time for traffic lights. Generally, they are positioned at junctions, intersections, ‘X’ roads, pedestrian crossings etc. and alternate the priority of who has to wait and who has to go
This is a simple project that helps to control the traffic signals, detection of vehicle dinsity and make flow of traffic go smoothly and in atimely manner.
## Features
Simple, low-cost, and real time density based traffic signal system that aims to overcome the time wasted under traffic light on working days and many problems and improves the traffic system.This system is based on NodeMCU and webcam.
